requires typescript:
    either npm install (it is saved as a dependency in this repo)
        or
    npm install -g typescript 

cd into the directory with your .ts files to be compiled and type "tsc fileName.ts" and a fileName.js will be created alongside it, reference that js in your application.
    e.g. tsc greeter.ts // this will transpile only greeter.ts, by default it transpiles to .js of the same name in the same location
